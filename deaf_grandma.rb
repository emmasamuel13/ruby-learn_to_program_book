#Deaf grandma. Whatever you say to Grandma (whatever you type in), she should respond with this:
#HUH?! SPEAK UP, SONNY!

#unless you shout it (type in all capitals). If you shout, she can hear you (or at least she thinks so) and yells back:
#NO, NOT SINCE 1938!

#To make your program really believable, have Grandma shout adifferent year each time, maybe any year at random between 1930 and 1950.
#You canâ€™t stop talking to Grandma until you shout BYE.
